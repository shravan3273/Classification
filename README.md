# Classification
we will utilise the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The values represent the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digital image.
The Breast cancer dta includes 569 observations of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features.
All the features seem to relate to the shape and size of the cell nuclei. Unless you are an Oncologist, you are unlikely to know how each relates to benign or malignant masses.
